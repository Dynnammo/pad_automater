# Pad automater
## Purpose of this project
Working for the third-place [La Myne](https://lamyne.org), we want to have a script that do the following work:
- Recover all available public pads of our Hedgedoc instance
- Push them in a simple to use no-code database like NocoDB
- Plug scripts to sum up pads related to a same project

## Current state of the project
⚠️ The project is under heavy development and is subject to breaking changes ⚠️
